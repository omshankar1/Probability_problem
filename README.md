# Probability_problem
Solution to the problem in probability
Write a program that calculates the probability for an n-sided die labelled with integers from 1 to n, to roll all the numbers {1, ..., n}, in any order if the die is thrown n times. 

e.g. A tetrahedral die can be made from four equilateral triangles. If the sides are labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4, what is the probability of throwing the die four times and getting {1, 2, 3, 4} in any order?

Investigate how your program scales for moderately large numbers, such as n=1000.
